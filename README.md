# Tic-tac-toe Rest API
##### PHP backend services for TicTacToe UI

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

## Setting up the environment
After pulling the repository, make sure you have docker installed on your machine.
Then go to the root directory and start terminal.
Execute:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
**This procedure will take care of creating the following containers**:
- php-fpm
- nginx
- mysql

At the end of the building, your application microservices are available at 
```bash
http://localhost:8000/
```
To stop docker containers  go to the root directory and start terminal.
Execute:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
